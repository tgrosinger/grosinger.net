            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the summer of 2018, ZoÃ« and I moved to Orcas Island. Here we are
learning about small-scale farming and sustainable living. In the future we
hope to create a community space where we give back to the community that
welcomed and supported us.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Orcas Food Co-op is a local business, providing healthy, local, organic
food to the community of Orcas Island, and several surrounding islands. As a
co-op, our goals are set by the membership, and we strive to be an exemplar
business with livable wages, equitable and affordable access, zero-waste, and
local products. As we finish off 2020 the co-op is growing faster than ever,
with several expansion projects underway.</p>
<p>As a member of the board, the community has elected me to help the co-op
realize those goals they set. I work closely with the general manager to
review the financial health of the business, and participate in monthly
meetings with the management staff to strategize how the co-op can continue
to better serve our island communities.</p>]]></content>

            <title>Advanced Markdown Tables</title>
            <link>https://grosinger.net/timeline/advanced_markdown_tables/</link>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Improved navigation, formatting, manipulation, and even formulas in Markdown tables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Improved navigation, formatting, manipulation, and even formulas in Markdown tables.</p>
<p>I am an avid proponent of maintaining a personal wiki, or personal knowledge
base. This can be as simple as a paper journal, or as complicated as programs
like DEVONthink and ROAM Research. Over the last 10 years I have experimented
with nearly a dozen approaches, but the last few have been fairly minor
tweaks.</p>
<p>To reduce the wiki churn, I realized I needed a method which could be easily
converted into any format in the future, was universally supported, and was
relatively extensible. I tried out <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> for a
while, but even with Evil mode, I didn&rsquo;t enjoy spending time in emacs.</p>
<p>I completed what I hope to be my last wiki migration over the 2020 summer,
switching to Markdown. It&rsquo;s simple, it&rsquo;s used everywhere, and it seems to be
gaining ground in the personal wiki space rapidly. But leaving org-mode did
have some shortfalls. It has amazing utilities for editing tables.</p>
<p>Building off of the excellent library started by
<a href="https://github.com/susisu">susisu</a>, I have been working on adding advanced
features to tables in Markdown. With an editor that has this library
incorporated (often possible though a plugin), Markdown tables become nearly
as powerful as they are in org-mode. Automatic formatting,
adding/moving/removing columns, sorting, and now even some spreadsheet
capabilities are all possible in plain-text Markdown tables.</p>

<p>I hope this enables you to make the jump to a Markdown-based wiki.</p>
<p>I recommend <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>.</p>]]></content>

            <title>Start a Community Makerspace</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;A space for all to bring their ideas to the real world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A space for all to bring their ideas to the real world.</p>
<p>Everyone should have the opportunity to bring their ideas to life. For some
people this requires just a computer and a flat work surface. For others
however, more infrasructure may be required &hellip;like tablesaws, and welders.</p>
<p>At our home on Orcas Island, I am fortunate enough to have lots of tools and
space. My question now is how to open those up to my wonderful community in a
way that is safe and sustainable. I don&rsquo;t have all the answers for this
project yet, but it is a goal I am working towards.</p>
