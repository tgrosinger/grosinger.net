The Orcas Food Co-op is a local business, providing healthy, local, organic
food to the community of Orcas Island, and several surrounding islands. As a
co-op, our goals are set by the membership, and we strive to be an exemplar
business with livable wages, equitable and affordable access, zero-waste, and
local products. As we finish off 2020 the co-op is growing faster than ever,
with several expansion projects underway.

As a member of the board, the community has elected me to help the co-op
realize those goals they set. I work closely with the general manager to
review the financial health of the business, and participate in monthly
meetings with the management staff to strategize how the co-op can continue
to better serve our island communities.
