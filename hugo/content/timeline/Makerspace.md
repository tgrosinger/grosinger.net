A space for all to bring their ideas to the real world.

<!--more-->

Everyone should have the opportunity to bring their ideas to life. For some
people this requires just a computer and a flat work surface. For others
however, more infrasructure may be required ...like tablesaws, and welders.

At our home on Orcas Island, I am fortunate enough to have lots of tools and
space. My question now is how to open those up to my wonderful community in a
way that is safe and sustainable. I don't have all the answers for this
project yet, but it is a goal I am working towards.

### Inspiration:

- Makerspaces, such as [Artisan's Asylum](https://artisansasylum.com/)
- Tool libraries, such as the [NE Seattle Tool Library](https://neseattletoollibrary.org/), where I was on the steering committee while I lived in Seattle.
- [Cooperative organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative), where the business exists only to serve the people.
- [MMM HQ](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/hq/) - coworking meets makerspace.
- [Anacortes Cottage Hobby House](https://cottagehobbyhouse.com/)
