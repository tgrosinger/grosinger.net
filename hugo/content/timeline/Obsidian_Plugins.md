Several plugins for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). See
[grosinger.dev](https://grosinger.dev) for more details.

Ever since the Obsidian team released the beta public API, plugin development
has been a major component of my morning routine. Developing plugins not only
shapes this tool to better suite my needs, but also teaches me more about UI
development than I ever expected. At this point I am very comfortable with
TypeScript, Svelte, and React, and even becoming more comfortable with CSS.

I couldn't be happier with what these projects have helped me achieve, and
greatly enjoy this part of my morning every day.

Take a look at the plugins I have created at
[grosinger.dev](https://grosinger.dev).
